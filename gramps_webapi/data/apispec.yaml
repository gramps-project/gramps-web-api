          A user defined custom filter expression consisting of one of more filter rules to be used when generating the result set.


          This filter is built and applied dynamically, it is not saved like a custom filter. It consists of one or more rules acting in combination, some of which can accept custom filters as arguments.


          The expression must be provided in JSON format and a number of fields are not required and have defaults if not present. The structure is defined as follows:


          {"function": function, "invert": invert, "rules": [{"name": name, "values": [values], "regex": regex}]}


          The function value is a string for the logical operation. Valid values are 'and', 'or', 'xor' and 'one'. If not present the default is 'and'.


          The invert value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if the results should be inverted. If not present the default is false.


          The rules consists of the list of rules to be evaluated. It is a mandatory field.


          The name in a rule entry is the name of a predefined rule.  A list of rules with their names and descriptions can be obtained from the filters endpoint. It is a mandatory field.


          The values list in the rule entry is optional and defaults to an empty list if not present.  Some rules take no arguments and others may take one or more arguments of different types that would need to be provided here.


          The regex value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if text values should be treated as regular expressions. If not present the default is false.

          A user defined custom filter expression consisting of one of more filter rules to be used when generating the result set.


          This filter is built and applied dynamically, it is not saved like a custom filter. It consists of one or more rules acting in combination, some of which can accept custom filters as arguments.


          The expression must be provided in JSON format and a number of fields are not required and have defaults if not present. The structure is defined as follows:


          {"function": function, "invert": invert, "rules": [{"name": name, "values": [values], "regex": regex}]}


          The function value is a string for the logical operation. Valid values are 'and', 'or', 'xor' and 'one'. If not present the default is 'and'.


          The invert value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if the results should be inverted. If not present the default is false.


          The rules consists of the list of rules to be evaluated. It is a mandatory field.


          The name in a rule entry is the name of a predefined rule.  A list of rules with their names and descriptions can be obtained from the filters endpoint. It is a mandatory field.


          The values list in the rule entry is optional and defaults to an empty list if not present.  Some rules take no arguments and others may take one or more arguments of different types that would need to be provided here.


          The regex value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if text values should be treated as regular expressions. If not present the default is false.

          This filter is built and applied dynamically, it is not saved like a custom filter. It consists of one or more rules acting in combination, some of which can accept custom filters as arguments.


          The expression must be provided in JSON format and a number of fields are not required and have defaults if not present. The structure is defined as follows:


          {"function": function, "invert": invert, "rules": [{"name": name, "values": [values], "regex": regex}]}


          The function value is a string for the logical operation. Valid values are 'and', 'or', 'xor' and 'one'. If not present the default is 'and'.


          The invert value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if the results should be inverted. If not present the default is false.


          The rules consists of the list of rules to be evaluated. It is a mandatory field.


          The name in a rule entry is the name of a predefined rule.  A list of rules with their names and descriptions can be obtained from the filters endpoint. It is a mandatory field.


          The values list in the rule entry is optional and defaults to an empty list if not present.  Some rules take no arguments and others may take one or more arguments of different types that would need to be provided here.


          The regex value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if text values should be treated as regular expressions. If not present the default is false.

          This filter is built and applied dynamically, it is not saved like a custom filter. It consists of one or more rules acting in combination, some of which can accept custom filters as arguments.


          The expression must be provided in JSON format and a number of fields are not required and have defaults if not present. The structure is defined as follows:


          {"function": function, "invert": invert, "rules": [{"name": name, "values": [values], "regex": regex}]}


          The function value is a string for the logical operation. Valid values are 'and', 'or', 'xor' and 'one'. If not present the default is 'and'.


          The invert value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if the results should be inverted. If not present the default is false.


          The rules consists of the list of rules to be evaluated. It is a mandatory field.


          The name in a rule entry is the name of a predefined rule.  A list of rules with their names and descriptions can be obtained from the filters endpoint. It is a mandatory field.


          The values list in the rule entry is optional and defaults to an empty list if not present.  Some rules take no arguments and others may take one or more arguments of different types that would need to be provided here.


          The regex value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if text values should be treated as regular expressions. If not present the default is false.

          This filter is built and applied dynamically, it is not saved like a custom filter. It consists of one or more rules acting in combination, some of which can accept custom filters as arguments.


          The expression must be provided in JSON format and a number of fields are not required and have defaults if not present. The structure is defined as follows:


          {"function": function, "invert": invert, "rules": [{"name": name, "values": [values], "regex": regex}]}


          The function value is a string for the logical operation. Valid values are 'and', 'or', 'xor' and 'one'. If not present the default is 'and'.


          The invert value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if the results should be inverted. If not present the default is false.


          The rules consists of the list of rules to be evaluated. It is a mandatory field.


          The name in a rule entry is the name of a predefined rule.  A list of rules with their names and descriptions can be obtained from the filters endpoint. It is a mandatory field.


          The values list in the rule entry is optional and defaults to an empty list if not present.  Some rules take no arguments and others may take one or more arguments of different types that would need to be provided here.


          The regex value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if text values should be treated as regular expressions. If not present the default is false.

          A user defined custom filter expression consisting of one of more filter rules to be used when generating the result set.


          This filter is built and applied dynamically, it is not saved like a custom filter. It consists of one or more rules acting in combination, some of which can accept custom filters as arguments.


          The expression must be provided in JSON format and a number of fields are not required and have defaults if not present. The structure is defined as follows:


          {"function": function, "invert": invert, "rules": [{"name": name, "values": [values], "regex": regex}]}


          The function value is a string for the logical operation. Valid values are 'and', 'or', 'xor' and 'one'. If not present the default is 'and'.


          The invert value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if the results should be inverted. If not present the default is false.


          The rules consists of the list of rules to be evaluated. It is a mandatory field.


          The name in a rule entry is the name of a predefined rule.  A list of rules with their names and descriptions can be obtained from the filters endpoint. It is a mandatory field.


          The values list in the rule entry is optional and defaults to an empty list if not present.  Some rules take no arguments and others may take one or more arguments of different types that would need to be provided here.


          The regex value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if text values should be treated as regular expressions. If not present the default is false.

          This filter is built and applied dynamically, it is not saved like a custom filter. It consists of one or more rules acting in combination, some of which can accept custom filters as arguments.


          The expression must be provided in JSON format and a number of fields are not required and have defaults if not present. The structure is defined as follows:


          {"function": function, "invert": invert, "rules": [{"name": name, "values": [values], "regex": regex}]}


          The function value is a string for the logical operation. Valid values are 'and', 'or', 'xor' and 'one'. If not present the default is 'and'.


          The invert value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if the results should be inverted. If not present the default is false.


          The rules consists of the list of rules to be evaluated. It is a mandatory field.


          The name in a rule entry is the name of a predefined rule.  A list of rules with their names and descriptions can be obtained from the filters endpoint. It is a mandatory field.


          The values list in the rule entry is optional and defaults to an empty list if not present.  Some rules take no arguments and others may take one or more arguments of different types that would need to be provided here.


          The regex value is a boolean, true or false, that indicates if text values should be treated as regular expressions. If not present the default is false.

          There are a core set of options common to all reports, and then sometimes additional options
          specific to a given report. A few reports do not have defaults for all options and require
          some be specified in order to run properly.


          If no _off_ option for report output file format is provided then pdf will be used as a fallback.
          The _of_ option for output file is rejected by this endpoint as the report file is ephemeral.
